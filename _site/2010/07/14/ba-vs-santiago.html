  <h1 class="post-title">BA vs Santiago</h1>
  <span class="post-date">14 Jul 2010</span>
  <p>When I first visited Santiago this past January, it was my first time <br />in South America. When I moved to Santiago in March, I had yet to <br />visit any other South American countries. In a sense, I moved to <br />Santiago without properly surveying the competition. My past few days <br />in Buenos Aires have given me a glimpse of how might life might have <br />been had I chosen this large South American city instead.
<p> Here are some major differences I've noticed:
<p> - Size: BA is really huge. Yesterday, I walked for two hours from my <br />centrally-located hotel to meet someone for lunch in a different <br />neighborhood of the city. Santiago is big, too, but the outer areas <br />seem more suburban whereas any part of the citycity I can imagine <br />walking to in under an hour.
<p> - Wealth: I'm pretty unclear, at any given time, of what type of <br />neighborhood I am in. This is partially because I don't know the city <br />very well. But, for example, I was told that Palermo is very upscale. <br />When walking through it, however, I didn't really feel like it was any <br />more upscale than the other parts of the city I had been to. In <br />Santiago, on the other hand, it is pretty obvious that the closer one <br />gets to the cordillera, the wealthier the neighborhood.
<p> - Language: my first day here, I was shocked at how many groups of <br />Americans I walked by on the street. Chileans also rarely try to speak <br />English with me. In fact, it kind of offends me when Chileans speak <br />English to me because so few of them do, I feel like it is insulting <br />to my Spanish skills (I think of my Spanish as better than the average <br />Chilean's English). Here, trying to speak English seems to be the <br />default when dealing with people such as myself who speak Spanish but <br />not fluently.
<p> - Saying goodbye: when I first moved to Santiago, I had to constantly <br />remind myself to say "ciao" instead of "adios." Nobody, it turns out, <br />says "adios." In BA, the phrase of choice is "hasta luego." I like the <br />friendliness of it.
<p> - Homeless dog population: it actually seems much smaller here, <br />although there is plenty of poop on the sidewalks to prove otherwise. <br />This is probably because Santiago's street cleaners are very vigilant. <br />Both cities believe strongly in dog sweaters.
<p> - Street vendors: I've gotten so used to the constant paranoid state <br />of street vendors in Santiago that I didn't realize it could be any <br />different. Here, street vendors actually seem rather disinterested in <br />passersby and do not seem worried about getting busted by the police. <br />People selling tights/socks/younameit on the streets of Santiago also <br />yell about their products a lot, saying they are <br />great/cheap/lifechanging. My Spanish teacher told me this is called <br />being "cargante." Nobody in BA is cargante.
<p> - People-car relationships: It gets a little awkward in Santiago <br />sometimes when I am standing on a quiet corner with a Chilean and it <br />is obvious that no cars are coming for miles but the light is red and <br />so he is waiting. Do I go and risk looking like an asshole American, <br />or stay and waste valuable minutes of my life standing on a deserted <br />street corner? In BA, people are very aggressive about crossing the <br />street. I saw a nun in all white jaywalk yesterday.
<p> - Style: Porte√±os really are more stylish. The number one article of <br />clothing I see on young women in Santiago is tight, acid-washed jeans. <br />In BA, it is all about leather boots, black coats, and beautiful long <br />hair. There are also way more blonds here, a definite advantage for <br />people like me who really stand out in Santiago.
<p> - PDA: I haven't seen a young couple slowly, passionately make out in <br />public for days. I'm not going to say I miss it, because I don't. But <br />I do wonder why I have seen significantly less PDA here.
<p> There is so much more, but this is the high-level list. Oh yeah, and <br />one more thing:
<p> - Indoor heating: despite staying in a pretty nice hotel, there is <br />definitely no heat here, either. Looks like I will be sleeping under <br />three blankets tonight, just like back in Santiago!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>
