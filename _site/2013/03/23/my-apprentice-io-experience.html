  <span class="post-date">23 Mar 2013</span>
  <p dir="ltr"><a href="http://jessieay.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/thoughtbot.png"><img class="size-full wp-image alignleft" id="i-161287201" alt="Image" src="/assets/thoughtbot.png?w=410" width="410" height="410" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">From October through December of 2012, I was an Apprentice with thoughtbot's <a href="https://www.apprentice.io/">apprentice.io</a> program. People often ask me what my experience was coming into the program, how I liked it, and what I'm doing now, so I thought I'd take a few minutes to write all of this down in hopes of helping others who are interested in the program.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Pre apprentice.io experience</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I attended my first <a href="http://workshops.railsbridge.org/">Railsbridge</a> workshop in September 2010. At that point, I'd done some HTML and CSS editing with Dreamweaver and that was about the extent of my web development knowledge. I was a philosophy and government major in college, so I had no computer science background whatsoever. Needless to say, I came out of my first workshop with almost zero understanding of Ruby or Rails. My day job was doing marketing for a start-up, but I continued to attend Railsbridge workshops. At one point, I had attended so many that I memorized the curriculum. While I still understood relatively little about web development, after a year I began teaching Railsbridge and looking for ways to bring my programming knowledge to the next level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At that point, I applied for a few engineering intern positions. I specifically remember flubbing a basic question about iterating over an array in an interview. It was obvious to me at that point that I needed to do some more solo study before jumping into even an intern-level position. For the next year, I worked on marketing for 3 days a week and I studied programming two days a week. On my study days, I went through books and tutorials. I would occasionally get tired of books and try to make real apps, but would inevitably realize I didn't know enough to build anything from scratch and return to tutorials. Sometimes I would write in my <a href="http://jessiecodes.wordpress.com/">coding blog</a> about all of the micro lessons I was learning, but overall it was very slow going.</p>
<p>After a while, I realized that solo study was not getting me to the point I wanted to be as quickly as I wanted to get there. And so, in June 2012, I quit my job to attend <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a>. I could (and will) write an entire blog post about Dev Bootcamp, but the short of it is: attending Dev Bootcamp took me from only being able to complete tutorials to being able to see a feature description and build it. After graduating from Dev Bootcamp, I started my apprenticeship with apprentice.io in San Francisco.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>apprentice.io experience</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Given my background, apprentice.io was a perfect next step for me. While Apprentices come in at all different levels, you can take advantage of the opportunity most if you are strong enough with Ruby and Rails to pair with thoughtbot developers on client work. Apprentices are encouraged to spend their time doing whatever they think will most help them level up their skills, but I saw apprentice.io as a unique opportunity to work on a real live projects with real live developers without the pressure of shipping code quickly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Apprentices are assigned a different mentor for each of the three months of their apprenticeship. This means that you as an apprentice always have one dedicated person to go to for help. I spent approximately 50% of my time as an apprentice pairing with my mentors, which means that I spent hundreds of hours coding with top-tier web developers. Many thoughtbot employees were themselves apprentices at one point in time, so there is a strong culture of teaching and helping others. Each of my mentors was on a different project, so I also got good exposure to the different types of projects. In addition, my apprenticeship was a great transition from practicing web development to doing web development on real live code bases.</p>
<p>Although I'd already spent 2.5 years learning how to code when I started my apprenticeship, there were several aspects of real live web development that were entirely new to me. One aspect, which is particular to thoughtbot, is <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. I learned to code using Textmate, but people at thoughtbot predominantly use Vim. While it is not required, it is difficult to pair with thoughtbot developers if you can't use Vim. So, I spent the first few weeks of my apprenticeship playing lots of <a href="http://vim-adventures.com/">vim-adventures</a> and acclimating myself to writing code without my mouse. I've learned to love Vim, but I would be lying if I didn't say that it made me want to throw my keyboard at the wall a few times an hour during my first couple of weeks as an apprentice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The second aspect of web development that was new to me was <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>. I had always used git as a way to version control my Ruby programs and Rails apps, but I'd only used it as a backup. My commit messages were uninformative and unimportant, and I rarely collaborated with anyone on a project using git branches or pull requests. At thoughtbot, there are standards around branch names, commit message formatting and syntax, and the entire git process. Learning how to effectively use git on a team was a large part of my apprenticeship and an important thing to know before jumping into any real code base.</p>
<p>The third major lesson of my apprenticeship was on writing small, cohesive commits. Before my apprenticeship, my own coding process was controlled chaos. For example, I'd want to build a way to add comments to a blog post, so I'd write a migration, then add routes, then notice I hadn't tested something for another model and do that, and then write some markup and then add some css to my home page and then commit it all at once before going to lunch. In a real life project, this would not fly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At thoughtbot, any code that I write begins with a bug report or feature request that is very specific. All of the code I write is on a git branch and is specific to that one feature. If I notice that something else needs to be done, I will write up a Trello card or Pivotal Tracker story (depending on which tool we're using for the project) and work on it later. If a branch is getting too large, I will often decide to break it up into two features so that it is easier for my coworkers to read my pull request. Oh yes, and we do pull requests. All code is peer-reviewed before being committed into the master branch. This took a while to get used to, but is an invaluable real-world lesson for any web developer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I certainly expanded my knowledge of Ruby, Rails, Rspec, and all of the fundamentals during my apprenticeship, but the three lessons above are aspects of web development that I could never have learned from a class or a book. Learning them requires working on a real code base with other developers all day long.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Post apprentice.io experience</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In January 2013, I accepted a full time developer position with thoughtbot. My three months as an Apprentice were a great trial period, and after getting to know the company and people, I knew it would be a great place for me to work. I now spend my days writing Ruby and Javascript, reviewing pull requests, and discussing the merits of various Vim commands with my fellow thoughtbotters. I would recommend apprentice.io to anyone who wants to make the transition from learning web development from a book to working on real projects. There are currently apprentices in San Francisco and Boston and apprenticeships start on a rolling basis.</p>
