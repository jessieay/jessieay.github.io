<p>Earlier this week, I was on an email chain with my Summer 2012 Dev Bootcamp cohort and someone mentioned that we, as a group, had failed to recognize or celebrate our 1 year anniversary of starting the program. I went back in gcal to look at what I'd written for June 10, 2012. There was nothing. How could I have failed to mark such an important day in my life?</p>
<p>As I've <a href="http://jessieay.wordpress.com/2013/03/23/my-apprentice-io-experience/">written before</a>, I attended my first Railsbridge workshop in September 2010. That was my first programming experience and it set off a snowball effect: I began to slowly get more and more serious about learning to code until it finally got to the point, almost 2 years later, where I thought I could make the leap from start-up marketer to developer.</p>
<p><strong>Let me give you a snapshot of myself at this Railsbridge in 2010: </strong></p>
<p>I had opened up the Terminal app a handful of times in my entire life. Each time was alongside a developer at my company who would watch me deploy changes to our marketing website. I didn't know an IDE from an IUD. An MVC from a VCR. A UNIX command from a line of Ruby code. I was starting from square 1 and I was OK with that. Because it was just for a fun weekend workshop.</p>
<p>In between then and now, Dev Bootcamp was a small but crucial part of helping me transition from totally clueless to full-time developer. And I want to go into a few details of why that is. But first, <strong>let me give you a snapshot of myself today: </strong></p>
<p>iTerm 2 is one of the handful of apps I always have open on both my home and work laptops. I don't have a text editor open, because I do all of my code writing in Vim. I just deployed a small update to my <a href="http://www.jessieayoung.com/">personal website</a> from my favorite coffee shop. I have an evolving opinion on CoffeeScript. I have a strong opinion about Capybara vs Cucumber.</p>
<p>This is not to say that I am magically a programming genius or expert. Yesterday, a guy asked me which implementation of Ruby I am using and I replied with a blank stare. Two days ago, I had some tests failing because my database_cleaner strategy was set to deletion instead of truncation, and I'm still not 100% sure what the difference is. Sometimes all my tests fail because I forget to run rake db:test:prepare, and I spend 30 minutes getting really frustrated until I remember that I forgot to run rake db:test:prepare.</p>
<p>I still spend a lot of time feeling like I must be an awesome actor if I am able to convince everyone that I am really a developer. But then I realize: Hey! I am a developer! So in honor of my one year Dev Bootcamp anniversary, I want to outline a few reasons why I would not be where I am today if it had not been for those intense 10 weeks:</p>
<p><strong>1. Dev Bootcamp forced me to shift from the mindset of "I'd like to be a developer" to "I'm going to be a developer"</strong></p>
<p>Before I quit my job and threw down a bunch of money for Dev Bootcamp, I wavered on whether or not I could really make the transition. The pure act of leaving my perfectly good job to go through an intensive learning program raised the stakes. I stopped wondering <i>if</i> I would be good enough to get a job as a developer and began focusing on <i>when</i> I would be good enough to get a job as a developer.</p>
<p><strong>2. Dev Bootcamp gave me time and motivation to put in my programming hours</strong></p>
<p>Learning anything complicated takes a significant number of hours of just doing and doing and doing in order to become competent. The old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">10,000 hour rule</a>. During the two years before Dev Bootcamp, I'd spent a lot of time trying to find time to learn. I'd go to a cafe with a programming book on a Saturday and try to read. I'd meet up with friends and work on tutorials together. I'd go to hack nights to get help with problems I ran into. But that took up maybe 10-15 hours a week. It wasn't enough.</p>
<p>Dev Bootcamp was only 10 weeks, but the hours were long and packed. With almost 100% pair programming and a strict rule against phones and checking email, almost every hour I spent at Dev Bootcamp was an honest hour of programming. And I wasn't just there for 10 hours a week. Alongside my 40 highly-motivated classmates, I was there for closer to 60 or 70.</p>
<p><strong>3. Dev Bootcamp taught me that I can learn anything</strong></p>
<p>The teachers at Dev Bootcamp are amazing, but even the best teacher cannot do the learning for you. With only 10 weeks, (9 now), they often have to throw brand new concepts at you and expect you to work with them immediately. I specifically remember learning RSpec in week 3 or 4. I had just started to really understand the Ruby code I was writing, and now I had to write it only after writing an test in a brand new DSL? Starting right now?? Forever??? We were pointed to a handy cheat sheet and told "go." I spent a few hours writing tests that validated that new instances of an object were, in fact, instances of that object. But fast forward a week and I loved testing.</p>
<p>In my job as as developer, I am constantly being asked to learn new things. Whether it's a new language, syntax, or framework, I approach my job as if I have <a href="https://twitter.com/thompson_caleb/status/345625213255434242">zero knowledge and infinite intelligence</a>. That is to say: I'm not expected to know everything, but I am certainly expected to figure it out. Dev Bootcamp was my first taste of what this is like, and it was an environment that encouraged us to admit that we knew nothing and then attack whatever was in front of us with spirit and determination.</p>
<p><strong>4. Dev Bootcamp made me feel legit</strong></p>
<p>I recently met up with a friend who is thinking about doing Dev Bootcamp. She currently does QA and would like to be a developer at her company. There might be the opportunity to intern for the engineering department, but she told me that she doesn't feel ready. She thinks she might need an program like Dev Bootcamp before she will be ready to make the change.</p>
<p>Here is what I told her:</p>
<p>You will never feel ready. The question is: how unready are you willing to feel? Sure, you learn a TON at Dev Bootcamp. And you learn the best from the best. But the specific lessons learned are not the point. Going through a program as well-regarded as Dev Bootcamp made me more confident in my ability to become a professional developer. I didn't graduate feeling exactly ready to tackle the world of programming, but I felt 30x more ready than I had before the 10 weeks.</p>
<p>Dev Bootcamp also legitimized me in other peoples' eyes. I had a ton of interviews after I graduated, and I noticed a real difference in the way I was approached by people who knew about Dev Bootcamp and those who had never heard of it. Those who knew about Dev Bootcamp knew exactly where I was coming from, technically speaking, and spent time determining whether I was a culture fit rather than making me do ridiculous white board challenges.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>A happy 1 year anniversary to me and my fellow Summer 2012 classmates. While seeing myself as a developer is an ongoing work in progress, we have all come so far. Let's not forget that.</p>
