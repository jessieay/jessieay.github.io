  <p>Just tried to post my Kindle highlights on Goodreads and was DENIED the space to include all 96. 
<div>So ready, get set, GO get informed about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict:</div>
<div>[these are all quotes from Thomas L. Friedman&#039;s <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6314962-from-beirut-to-jerusalem-2007-version">From Beirut to Jerusalem</a>]
<p> The starting point of Shi’ism is defeat: the defeat of Ali and his house….Its primary appeal is therefore to the defeated and oppressed. That is why it has so often been the rallying cry for the underdogs in the Muslim world…especially for the poor and dispossessed.</p>
<p> Despite the initial reluctance of the Sunnis and Shiites to be drawn into the Maronites’ Greater Lebanon, their leaders eventually reached a political understanding with the Christians in 1943 that enabled the Lebanese republic to become independent of France. The Muslims agreed to abandon their demands for unity with Syria, while the Maronites agreed to sever their ties with France and accept the notion that Lebanon would be an “Arab” country. This unwritten agreement, known as the National Pact, also stipulated that the Lebanese President would always be a Maronite and that the parliament would always have a 6:5 ratio of Christians to Muslims—to ensure Christian predominance—while the Prime Minister would always be a Sunni Muslim and the Speaker of the Parliament always a Shiite—to ensure the country’s Arab-Muslim character.</p>
<p> Most of the early Zionists either ignored the presence of the Arabs already living in Palestine or assumed they could either be bought off or would eventually submit to Jewish domination. Following World War I, Palestine fell under British control, in the same way that Lebanon had fallen to the French.<br /> Out of the broad region known as Palestine, Britain carved two political entities in 1921.</p>
<p>As the Jewish-Palestinian conflict sharpened in the wake of a massive influx of European Jewish survivors of World War II, Britain announced its intention to withdraw from the western half of Palestine and wash its hands of the problem of who should rule there. London turned over to the United Nations responsibility for determining the fate of this disputed territory, and on November 29, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly voted 33 to 13 with 10 abstentions to partition western Palestine into two states—one for the Jews, which would consist of the Negev Desert, the coastal plain between Tel Aviv and Haifa, and parts of the northern Galilee, and the other for the Palestinian Arabs, which would consist primarily of the West Bank of the Jordan, the Gaza District, Jaffa, and the Arab sectors of the Galilee. Jerusalem, cherished by both Muslims and Jews as a holy city, was to become an international enclave under UN trusteeship.</p>
<p> The Zionists, then led by David Ben-Gurion, accepted this partition plan, even though they had always dreamed of controlling all of western Palestine and Jerusalem. The Palestinian Arabs and the surrounding Arab states rejected the partition proposal. They felt that Palestine was all theirs, that the Jews were a foreign implant foisted upon them, and that they had the strength to drive them out. Just before the British completed their withdrawal on May 14, 1948, the Zionists declared their own state, and the next day the Palestinians, aided by the armies of Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq, launched a war to prevent Jewish independence and to secure control of all of western Palestine. In the course of that war, the Zionists not only managed to hold all the areas assigned to them by the United Nations but to seize part of the land designated for the Palestinian state as well.</p>
<p> The other areas designated for the Palestinians by the United Nations were taken by Jordan and Egypt; Jordan annexed the West Bank, while Egypt assumed control of the Gaza District. Neither Arab state allowed the Palestinians to form their own independent government in these areas.</p>
<p> The PLO in those days was essentially a tool of the existing Arab regimes—intended to control the Palestinians as much as to support them.</p>
<p>The Lebanese Christians demanded that the Lebanese army be deployed to break the PLO state-within-a-state the way King Hussein had in Jordan. The Christians wanted the PLO out not only because it was disrupting Lebanese life but because without the Palestinian guerrillas, the Lebanese Muslims would be unable to press their demands for more power. The Muslims, in turn, opposed any crackdown on the PLO, which, in effect, had become their biggest private militia.</p>
<p> That was Beirut. No one was keeping score. No matter how you lived your life, whether you were decent or indecent, sinner or saint, it was all irrelevant. Men and women there could suffer wrenching tragedies once or twice or even three times, and then suffer some more.</p>
<p> I don’t know if Beirut is a perfect Hobbesian state of nature, but it is probably the closest thing to it that exists in the world today. If so, Hobbes was right about life in such a world being “nasty, brutish, and short,” but he was quite wrong about it being “poor” and “solitary.” Indeed, if I learned any lesson from living in Beirut it is that when authority breaks down and a society collapses into a state of nature, men will do anything to avoid being poor or solitary.</p>
<p> The golfers at the Beirut Club didn’t call their first hole a “dangerous par-5” for nothing. Several members were hit by bullets in their backswings there, because the 460-yard hole ran perpendicular to a PLO firing range.</p>
<p> Legend has it that one day a disheveled young man entered Goodies, walked up to the cash register with a rifle, and demanded all the money. Within seconds three different women drew pistols out of their Gucci handbags, pumped a flurry of bullets into the thief, and then continued pushing their shopping carts down the bountiful aisles.</p>
<p> <b>Today, the most frequently asked question in Beirut after a car bomb is not “Who did it?” or “How many people were killed?” It is “What did it do to the dollar rate?”</b></p>
<p>The most popular means of coping I saw in Beirut was simply learning to play mind games—games that eased one’s anxiety without actually removing any danger. For instance, Diala Ezzedine, a college student and Red Cross volunteer whom I met when she helped dig out the rubble of my own apartment, once told me that to calm herself during the worst bouts of violence she would make probability calculations in her head and try to convince herself that someone was actually keeping score. “I [would] say to myself, ‘There are 4 million people in Lebanon and so many in my family; what are the odds of anyone in my family getting killed?’”</p>
<p> I rarely heard any Beiruti admit that the violence around him was totally capricious and that the only thing that kept him alive was callous fate—which was the truth.<br />Every Beirut driver knows the radio lexicon: a road described as amina is totally secured by army or police; a road described as salika is free of snipers or kidnappers, but not policed; hatherah means the road is passable, but with a roughly 30 percent chance of kidnapping or sniping; and finally, ghair amina means the road is unsafe at any speed.</p>
<p> (Valium, though, is sold over the counter in Beirut, and the Lebanese are believed to be among the highest per capita users of the sedative in the world.)</p>
<p>the behavior of Beirutis suggested that man’s natural state is as a social animal who will do everything he can to seek out and create community and structures when the larger government or society disappears. Beirut was divided into a mosaic of neighborhoods, each tied together by interlocking bonds of family, friendship, and religion. When the larger, macro Beirut society and government splintered, people’s first instinct was to draw together into micro-societies based on neighborhood, apartment house, religious, or family loyalties.</p>
<p> <b>As Richard Day put it, “People discovered<br />
 something about their inner strength when they were tested, like a metal that can only achieve its real hardness at the highest temperature.”</b></p>
<p>“Though the average Lebanese derives much…social support and psychological reinforcement from…local and communal allegiances, these forces are the same elements that…prompt him on occasion to violate and betray his society’s normative standards. The Lebanese is being demoralized, in other words, by the very forces that are supposed to make him a more human and sociable being…The formation and deformation of Lebanon, so to speak, are rooted in the same forces.”</p>
<p> There is no truth in Beirut, only versions. —Bill Farrell Middle East correspondent THE NEW YORK TIMES</p>
<p>A reporter cannot possibly be fair and objective about a person or group if he doesn’t truly understand them, but he also cannot be fair if he understands them alone.<br /> any protagonist in the Middle East who is ready to talk to me cannot be worth talking to; he cannot be at the center of what is happening. It’s the people who won’t talk to me whom I really want to meet.</p>
<p>Bedouin Arabic proverb: “Me and my brother against our cousin. Me, my brother, and my cousin against the stranger.”</p>
<p> It was no accident that when Sadat returned to Cairo from his visit to Jerusalem and addressed the Egyptian parliament about his reasons for going, he kept referring to his people as “Ya, Sha’ab October”—Oh, you people of October—a reference to the Egyptians’ victory over Israel in the early stages of the October 1973 war. Only such a victorious people can make compromises. In his speech Sadat used the reference eighteen times.</p>
<p> The long tradition of authoritarianism in Middle East politics is related to the persistence of tribe-like affiliations. Because primordial, tribe-like loyalties governed men’s identities and political attitudes so deeply, the peoples of the Middle East (as elsewhere in the world for many centuries) rarely created nation-states of their own through which they could rule themselves and be strong enough to withstand foreign invaders. The warring tribes, clans, sects, neighborhoods, cities, and hinterlands could not find a way to balance the intimacy and cohesion of their tribe-like groups with the demands of a nationstate that would be run by certain neutral rules and values.</p>
<p> Precisely because so many brutal authoritarians rose up in the history of the Middle East, an entire body of Islamic political theory developed to justify even their style of rule—despite the fact that this style contravened all the precepts of Islamic political law, which demanded fair and consultative government.</p>
<p> Middle Eastern societies were primarily merchant societies, which dreaded chaos and feared what might happen if control from above was eliminated and all their tribes and sects went at each other. Therefore, Islamic political thinkers gradually began to argue that obedience to even the cruelest, most illegitimate, non-Islamic despot, who at least kept some order, was preferable to the greater evil of a society left to the depredations of endless internal warfare.</p>
<p> Or, as the ancient Arabic proverb put it: “Better sixty years of tyranny than one day of anarchy.”</p>
<p>Hama was not just what happens when two tribe-like sects—the Alawites and the Sunnis—decide to have it out; it was also what happens when a modern Middle Eastern autocrat who does not enjoy full legitimacy among his people puts down a challenge to his authority by employing twentieth-century weapons without restraint.</p>
<p> many of the states in the Middle East today—Egypt being the most notable exception—were not willed into existence by their own people or developed organically out of a common historical memory or ethnic or linguistic bond; they also did not emerge out of a social contract between rulers and ruled. Rather, their shapes and structure were imposed from above by the imperial powers. These shapes had little or no precedent in either the medieval or the ancient world. Rather, boundaries were drawn almost entirely on the basis of the foreign policy, communications, and oil needs of the Western colonial powers.</p>
<p> Instead of the state growing out of the nation, the nation was expected to grow out of the state.</p>
<p>The real name of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, for example, is Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti. Tikrit was the home village of Saddam and of virtually all the key conspirators who took power with him in the 1968 Iraqi coup d’état. After Saddam and his clique were in power for several years, any Iraqi who was from anywhere near Tikrit added al-Tikriti to his name in order to draw closer to the regime.</p>
<p> “The liberal tradition in the West tries to impute to the behavior of the native or the underdog an idealist position which is not really there,” argues the Lebanese historian Kemal Salibi. “They want to think of the peoples of this region as ‘noble savages,’ as Jean-Jacques Rousseau put it. Instead of saying, what we have here is an outmoded form of thinking clashing with an attempt to construct modern nation states….When it comes to thinking about Middle East politics, the American liberal mind is often chasing rainbows. They are living in a world of delusion.”</p>
<p> the Lebanese have a proverb: “He killed him and then marched in his funeral procession.”</p>
<p>I am convinced that there is only one man in Israel Hafez Assad ever feared and that is Ariel Sharon, because Assad knew that Sharon, too, was ready to play by Hama Rules. Assad knew Sharon well; he saw him every morning when he looked in the mirror.</p>
<p> At that very fluid moment between the end of World War I and the end of World War II, when all kinds of peoples were getting states of their own, the Palestinians missed the train, largely as a result of the failures of their own leaders and the conniving of their Arab brethren</p>
<p> It must be remembered that Arafat’s primary base of support during his Beirut days came from those Palestinians living in the refugee camps of Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria. They formed the ranks of his guerrilla army and filled the positions of his bureaucracy. They were the very soil from which the PLO sprang. Most of these Palestinian refugees hailed from towns and villages that fell within the boundaries of pre-1967 Israel—places such as Haifa or Jaffa or the Galilee. They were not particularly interested in a West Bank-Gaza Palestinian state, because that is not where they were from. Gaza was as far from their homes as Beirut. Therefore, they were always more inclined to a maximalist Palestinian political position that held on to the dream that one day Israel would disappear and they would be able to return to their actual homes. It was their aspirations which Arafat reflected in the 1960s and 1970s; it was their dreams to which he catered. Many Palestinians living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza would come to take a more realistic approach, since they had to contend with the reality of Israel every day, but during the 1960s and 1970s their influence on PLO positions was limited</p>
<p> The third attribute with which Arafat endowed the PLO was relevance. By unifying the Palestinian people under one banner, by creating an institutional framework to sustain that unity, Arafat assembled a critical mass behind the Palestinian cause that simply made it impossible to ignore</p>
<p> It was no coincidence that Arafat was first invited to address the United Nations in 1974, just as oil prices were going through the roof. One cannot understand the rise of the PLO without connecting it to the rise of OPEC.</p>
<p> Arafat was always a leader who reflected the consensus of his people; he did not shape it.</p>
<p>The law of Lebanese politics was: I have a checkpoint, therefore I exist. </p>
<p>Beirut, and the mini-state Arafat created there, drained the PLO leadership, and to some extent the rank and file, of the impatience a normal national liberation movement would feel about achieving its avowed objectives, which, in the case of the PLO, was the recovery of all or pa<br />
rt of Palestine. With its attractive nightlife, restaurants, and intellectual ferment, Beirut became for many PLO functionaries the watan al-badeel—the substitute homeland</p>
<p> the PLO leadership fell in love with their own press clippings. Headlines became a narcotic substitute for truly meaningful grassroots political or military actions and gave the PLO leaders a much exaggerated sense of their own strength. They mistook news reports for real power and theatrical gestures like hijackings for a real war with Israel.</p>
<p> The religious symbols of the West are the cross and the Jewish star—both of which are full of sharp, angled turns. The symbol of the Muslim East is the crescent moon—a wide, soft, ambiguous arc. In Arab society there was always some way to cushion failure with rhetoric and enable the worst of enemies to sit down and have coffee together, maybe even send each other bouquets.</p>
<p> Through their contacts with the Lebanese Maronites (the Lebanese Muslims were not interested in the Jews, and vice versa) a view began to take hold among early Zionists that Lebanon was a Christian society in the same way that theirs would be a Jewish society. Sure, like Israel, Lebanon also had an Arab-Muslim “minority,” said the Zionists, but it was basically a country dominated by Christian businessmen who would gladly recognize a Jewish state as soon as just one other Arab nation went first.</p>
<p> Had Israelis understood that the real Lebanon was two Lebanons, they would have understood that the only way to restore stability and sovereignty to the place was not by supporting only the Christians and driving out Yasir Arafat and his PLO guerrillas. The PLO’s presence was only a symptom of Lebanon’s ills;</p>
<p> With an economy so dependent on the Arab-Muslim world, Lebanon was destined to be the last Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel, because only after all the other Arab countries had reconciled themselves to the Jewish state could Lebanon afford to do so.</p>
<p> For the Phalangists, the summer of ’82 was simply another round in the Lebanese civil war that had begun in 1975. Their prime objective was not to get the PLO out of Lebanon as an end in itself; their prime objective was to win, definitively, the Lebanese civil war, so they would not have to make any power-sharing concessions to the Lebanese Muslims.<br /> Many Israelis had convinced themselves that there was no such thing as a legitimate Palestinian nation with a legitimate national claim to any part of Palestine. They saw the Palestinians instead as part of an undifferentiated Arab mass stretching from Morocco to Iraq and with no particular cultural, historical, or ethnic identity linked to the land of Palestine. This myth was one of the oldest and most enduring in Zionist history.</p>
<p> It was former Labor Party Prime Minister Golda Meir who said in a 1969 interview with The Sunday Times of London, when asked about the Palestinians, “They do not exist.”<br />Even after Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967 and was again confronted with large numbers of Palestinians, most Israelis preferred either not to see them, or referred to them, as Begin did, as “Arabs of the land of Israel.”</p>
<p> <b>Someone who sees himself as a victim will almost never morally evaluate himself or put limits on his own actions. Why should he? He is the victim.</b></p>
<p>The one thing the Arabs never did, though, was to take Arafat aside and tell him, “Look, my friend, the power realities are stacked against you. Your people got in the way of a bad storm called the Zionist movement. It could have happened to any of us, but it happened to you. If you really want to help your people, cut the best deal you can now with the Jews. Save whatever land you can and forget the rest.” Instead, as Fouad Ajami put it, “the Arabs walked away from the Palestinian cause while swearing eternal fidelity to the Palestinians.”</p>
<p> Given a choice between watching highlights about the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the World Cup soccer matches that were being played during the summer of ’82, most Arabs tuned in to the World Cup. This came as a bitter shock to many Palestinians. The PLO finally had its war and nobody came—nobody but Sharon. </p>
<p> Maybe Arafat was wise to leave Beirut in order to fight another day, as he argued at the time. But the PLO was never quite the same after it quit Lebanon, and neither for that matter was the Arab world.</p>
<p>The real Palestine was a dream: Lebanon was the concrete Palestine, where they had lived their lives, gone to school, and controlled the streets.</p>
<p> In the Israeli psyche you don’t come to the rescue of “terrorists.” There is no such thing as “terrorists” being massacred.</p>
<p>It was my introduction to a popular form of hypocrisy I would discover often on the road from Beirut to Jerusalem, what a Lebanese friend of mine liked to call “moral double bookkeeping.” All the players in the Middle East do it. They keep one set of moral books, which proclaim how righteous they are, to show the outside world, and one set of moral books, which proclaim how ruthless they are, to show each other.</p>
<p> The PLO leaders also didn’t really want to know what was happening in the West Bank, because really knowing would have required really doing something about it—“to be pressed by time,” in Abu Jihad’s words—and really doing something about it would have meant making either real concessions for peace or real preparations for war. Even after Beirut, Arafat was unable or unwilling to do either. He still behaved as though time were on his side, and in his view of history it was. In his view, the Zionists had no deep roots in Palestine; they were simply a post-Holocaust phenomenon foisted on the Middle East by the West and would one day wither away like other colonial implantations.</p>
<p> Arafat was telling them that as long as they remained displaced, their suffering might eventually bring liberation. It is always easier to give significance to suffering than to compel people to face a reality that offers only two choices: bad and worse—either a tiny Palestinian state in part of the West Bank and Gaza, possibly independent, possibly federated with Jordan, or nothing at all.</p>
<p> Once again Arafat would survive, not because of what he had produced, but because of what he symbolized.</p>
<p>But what Sharon never understood, because he had so demonized the PLO, was that Beirut was theater and Arafat was ready to star in it for a long time. All Arafat really wanted was a little turf for himself and his people and a chair in the Arab councils of power; Beirut afforded him that.</p>
<p> It wasn’t Palestine, but it was tolerable. It had become the substitute homeland and had Sharon left well enough alone, the PLO might still be there today. But Sharon took the Lebanese theater seriously. By driving Arafat and his guerrillas out, he re-created their dilemma of homelessness and made them wandering men again. He left them no option but to invest virtually all their energy in diplomacy, as opposed to armed struggle, with the aim of recovering precisely the turf where Sharon had planned to impose his rule: the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p> He who is fixated on redeeming his father’s memory will never see the opportunities of his own world.</p>
<p>“I was taught that Israel wants peace more than others and just wants to be left alone. After Lebanon, everything wasn’t so clear. I really felt anger.”</p>
<p> <b>typical tribal logic, which says, When I am weak, how can I compromise? When I am strong, why should I compromise?</b></p>
<p>Every region of the globe needs one city where the rules don’t apply, where sin is the norm, and where money can buy anything or anyone. Asia had Hong Kong, Europe had Monaco, and the Middle East had Beirut.</p>
<p> <b>There is only one thing worse than being shelled, and that is being shelled and turning on the BBC the next morning and not hearing it reported on the news.</b></p>
<p>“When will there be peace in Lebanon?” he asked in a voice larded with cynicism. “When the Lebanese start to love their<br />
 children more than they hate each other.”</p>
<p> “This is not a war, this is an earthquake. You can’t learn anything from an earthquake. When you have an earthquake, people just die. That’s what it’s like here. There are no obvious reasons for the fighting anymore. It just happens. Come rain or shine, sea or mountains; it just happens, like an earthquake.”</p>
<p> “All the myths are gone now,” said Salam, “but maybe that is the beginning of wisdom.</p>
<p>So, on the seventh day of the Six-Day War, amid the jubilation and flag waving, a huge question once again hung over the Israelis: Who were they? A nation of Jews living in all the land of Israel, but not democratic? A democratic nation in all the land of Israel, but not Jewish? Or a Jewish and democratic nation, but not in all the land of Israel?</p>
<p> <b>If there is one thing I have learned in the Middle East, it is that the so-called extremists or religious zealots, whether in Jewish or Muslim society, are not as extreme as we might think. The reason they are both tolerated and successful is that they are almost always acting on the basis of widely shared feelings or yearnings.</b></p>
<p> a pattern was begun in Hebron that would be repeated all over the West Bank during the next decade: Jewish settlers would go out and create facts, the government would respond halfheartedly, with some of the Labor ministers openly supporting the settlers, the government would reach some ambiguous compromise allowing them to stay, and then another group of settlers would go out and create another fact.</p>
<p> In America, advertising is the most hysterical and competitive between products that are virtually the same, such as dog food or breakfast cereal. The same applied to Labor and Likud. They each pointed to their written platforms and said, “Look how different we are from them,” but in daily life they were each selling the same Puppy Chow.</p>
<p> A consensus, said Eban, means that “everyone agrees to say collectively what no one believes individually.”</p>
<p><b>what is politics if not the making of hard choices, and what is leadership if not the framing of concrete choices for the public and then urging one over another?</b></p>
<p> <b>David Ben-Gurion had always understood that his first constituency was the facts and that his second constituency was his people, whose subjective will had to be shaped to the facts</b>.</p>
<p>Israeli politics had become like a daytime soap opera—the Jewish equivalent of As the World Turns. You could go away for two months and tune back in and find that you hadn’t missed a thing.</p>
<p> The tragedy and the irony of the Zionist revolution is that although it created all these instruments and institutions from the ashes of the Holocaust, it failed to eradicate the collective self-image of the Jew as victim. Although they can now speak their own language and walk with their heads held high, many Israelis today still feel as though they are victims of circumstance and living on borrowed time as much as any Jewish ghetto dwellers in history. They have not really broken out of the prison of their past.</p>
<p> <b>I used to meet many Jews from America and Western Europe who told me that they had come to Israel to “find” themselves as Jews. I always told them that Israel was probably the most confusing place in the world to do so. It is the place to lose yourself as a Jew, because if you don’t know who you are before you arrive, you can get totally lost in the maze of options that present themselves as soon as you plant your feet on the land.</b></p>
<p> If your eyes are on eternity you can be blind to the person sitting next to you.</p>
<p>When Israelis weigh making a deal with Arafat over the West Bank and Gaza Strip, they ask themselves, If I agree to give up these territories, will it be the end of the story between me and the Palestinians, even if Arafat has the best of intentions? The answer is no. They will still have to deal with Abu Nidal, Abu Musa, and all the other Palestinian refugees who refuse to live in the West Bank or Gaza and insist on returning to their homes in pre-1967 Israel. Therefore, they view the choice as between no peace with all the land and no peace with part of the land. Most of them would prefer no peace with all the land, at least for now. </p>
<p> news from modern Israel is more appealing and digestible for people in the West than from elsewhere, because the characters, the geography, and the themes involved are so familiar, so much a part of our cultural lenses.</p>
<div>These divine laws, delivered at Mount Sinai, formed the very basis of what became known as Judeo-Christian morality and ethics. Modern Israel, therefore, is expected to reflect a certain level of justice and morality in its actions.
<p> The media take a perverse pleasure in labeling Israel South Africa. It is the same pleasure you get when you catch your Sunday-school teacher misbehaving. If my Sunday-school teacher is misbehaving, then so can I.</p>
<p> <b>as one senior Israeli official put it, “Israelis are certain that America is a country that spends all its time being either for or against Israel.”</b></p>
</div>
<div>“Think of who you were in love with in high school. You didn’t really know that person. A real love is knowing someone and knowing their faults and accepting their faults and learning how to help them, and learning how to listen.</p>

<div><b>Travel and experience mar the grandest pictures and rob us of the most cherished traditions of our boyhood. Well, let them go. I have already seen the Empire of King Solomon diminish to the size of Pennsylvania; I suppose I can bear the reduction of the seas and the river.</b>
<p> We in the West who relate to these “revolutionary” countries only by reading the political banners they hold aloft are imputing to them higher ideological motives than they could ever meet. Don’t read their lips, just watch their moves. They may talk like fanatics, but they behave like grocers; they may preach martyrdom, but always for the other guy’s son.</p>
<p> There are no homeless in Israel; it is politically unacceptable for a state based on immigration to tolerate people sleeping on doorsteps.</p>
