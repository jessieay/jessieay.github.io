  <h1 class="post-title">6 ice breakers that don't make me hate everyone</h1>
  <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2011</span>
  <p>I wanted to start this post by saying that I hate ice breakers, but actually, in high school I was the Spirit Chair of my Youth and Government delegation and I loved making everyone play ice breakers. In that time and place, however, I felt very comfortable being a total nut in front of everyone so your average dumb ice breaker was fun for me. In the real world, ice breakers can be tricky. While the point of them is to have fun, not everyone is good at &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;letting loose&quot; and as a result everyone else feels awkward just watching those who are uncomfortable squirm under pressure.
<p> On my recent trip to Israel with 40 young Jewish Americans ages 22-26, we played some great ice breakers. I know they were great because I started out the trip very skeptical of the people but almost immediately felt comfortable with them as a result of the getting-to-know-you games we played. Everyone was smiling, got to know each other better, and even became re-energized during our ice breakers. So, I wrote my favorites down in a notebook to share with others later on. Here they are:
<p> 1. &quot;Whichever the wind&quot; - for this game, everyone needs to stand in a tight circle (I&#039;ve found that this formation is common in ice breakers). To start, one person stands in the middle, introduces herself, and says something about herself. For example, &quot;I am left handed.&quot; Everyone else in the circle who the statement is also true for or who agrees with the statement (it can be an opinion statement) must find a new place in the circle. At this point, it becomes a game of musical chairs as everyone rushes around to find a vacant spot in the circle and the person left without a spot must stand in the middle and say the next statement. The great thing about this game is that it combines getting to know people in a superficial, controlled way with a little bit of physical activity.
<p> 2. &quot;Apple game&quot; - this is a pure name-game. First, make sure that everyone in the circle says their name slowly once. Then, someone introduces an apple and throws it to to someone after saying his name (loudly). Once a person throws the apple, he sits down, so there is one less person to throw the apple to after each throw. After going through everyone once, it&#039;s fun to challenge the group to do it again but faster (we timed how long it took to do everyone&#039;s names both times). For our group, our leader asked us for ideas on how we could do it the fastest. First, we tried just each passing it to the person next to us in the circle. Then, we all got into a big huddle, making sure everyone had a finger on the apple (physical proximity breeds familiarity) and all shouted a name at the same time. It was silly but a truly effective way to learn 40 names in a short period of time.
<p> 3. &quot;Speed dating&quot; - this is a great way to get to know a few people more deeply. Set up two circles, the inner circle facing out and the outer circle facing in. The group leader comes up with a topic for each pair to talk about and they are given two minutes to each share their opinions. A topic can be anything, from something really deep to &quot;what&#039;s your favorite kind of food and why?&quot;Then, the inner or outer circle is told to move a certain number of steps and cover a new topic with a new partner. I really liked this game because when we were hanging out as a group later I was able to expand upon the short prompts with my speed dating partners, making for an easy conversation starter.
<p> 4. &quot;The introduction game&quot; - everyone pairs off and interviews their partner for five minutes each. After 10 minutes, each person then spends one minute introducing his or her partner to the entire group. This activity is time consuming, but a great way to learn a little bit about each person in a group and get to know one person more deeply. Also great for conversation fodder later on. Eg: &quot;That&#039;s so cool that you&#039;re a heart surgeon. What do you think of the health care reform bill?&quot;
<p> 5. &quot;Rock Paper Scissors, with teams&quot; - this was probably the craziest game we played, but it really energized the group. First, everyone gets up (not in a circle) and finds a random partner to play Rock, Paper, Scissors with. Ideally, this is a person you don&#039;t know very well so it&#039;s a good opportunity to learn his or her name. Whoever loses then must become the cheering squad for the winner. So if I lose to Jenny, I have to follow Jenny and cheer her on however I see fit while she continues to play Rock Paper Scissors. Should she win, the next loser joins me in cheering her on. If she loses, with both join the cheering squad of her opponent. The game ends with two players and everyone else cheering one person or the other on. It&#039;s entertaining because nobody really cares about who wins but the cheering can get heated.
<p> 6. &quot;What&#039;s your move?&quot; - this is better played once everyone is more comfortable with each other, even though it&#039;s also a name game. For this one, each person in the circle comes up with a dance move for his or her name. So if I go first, I might to the sprinkler move while saying &quot;Jessie.&quot; Everyone repeats my move and name. The next person, Joseph, does my move while saying my name, and then does his move while saying &quot;Joseph.&quot; Then everyone in the circle repeats the sequence. The next person goes, does both of our moves, and then his or her own. Etc. It can get really long, but the dance moves are a great opportunity for creativity and it&#039;s always good to play name games after the first few days of a group trip because it gets to a point where it&#039;s awkward not to know someone&#039;s name but also awkward to ask. So I highly recommend it!</p></p></p></p>
