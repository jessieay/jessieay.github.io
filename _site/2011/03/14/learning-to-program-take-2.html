  <h1 class="post-title">Learning to Program, Take 2</h1>
  <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2011</span>
  <p>I got a little lazy about programming. To be fair to me, I did have a pretty crazy February/March. I went to Israel and Las Vegas. The Holy City and Sin City. I also had virtually no internet in Israel, which was a great experience. I highly recommend going anywhere that won't allow you to check your email for 10 days.
<p> I dove back into Ruby this weekend after my 6 week hiatus and here's what I've learned:
<p>- Getting your machine set up to program is probably the hardest part, especially for someone with no background. For this reason, I'm really happy I went to the women's workshop through the <a href="http://www.sfruby.info/">San Francisco Ruby Meetup Group</a> because, even though I still have no idea what I'm doing, I at least know I'm starting out with the right tools.
<p> - I'm using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/RailsSpace-Building-Networking-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321480791">this</a> book, which walks you through the process of actually creating an application. The down side is the edition of RailsSpace that I have is that it's from 2008 (not sure if anything more current exists) which in Ruby years is pretty ancient. The good news is that I've actually learned the most through encountering problems while following the book, so its outdated-ness isn't necessarily a bad thing. Plus, the book has enough guidance and structure that I actually feel like I'm making progress rather than just wading around in a vast sea of code that I don't understand.
<p>- One of the most confusing things about starting out was that the book kept telling me I needed to open an "editor." Since I use a text editor to do HTML for work, I thought it was referring to that so I just opened TextEdit. Turns out, an "editor" or "IDE" in Rubyspeak is actually an application that shows your app's folders and lets you edit it in a more organized format. I'm using <a href="http://www.openkomodo.com/">Komodo</a> since that's what the people at the workshop recommended but I'll probably invest in TextMate once I get more seriously into Ruby stuff.
<p> - Today, my friend showed me <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">Ruby Koans</a>, which provides you with a set of tests that are made to fail and which you are meant to fix before moving on to the next test. So far, it's been a great way to learn basic Ruby (the language) whereas the book has you dive right into Rails as well. Since I know next to nothing about Ruby as a language, I plan on completing the Ruby Koans before going back to RailsSpace</p></p></p></p>
