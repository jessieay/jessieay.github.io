<p>I just watched an hour long <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOOmqHzkkOo">documentary on statistics</a>.
<p>Here&#039;s what I learned:
<p>The average person spends 24 years of his or her life asleep.
<p> The study of statistics began two centuries ago as a way for the state to monitor the people. The word &quot;statistics&quot; actually comes from the word &quot;state.&quot; Now, through organizations such as <a href="http://blog.crimespotting.org/">Crimespotting</a>, citizens are using statistics to keep the government accountable.
<p> In San Francisco, crime clusters around the flat areas and is sparse on steep hills (I&#039;m suddenly not so bitter about the 45 degree hill I must climb every time I walk home).
<p>There is so. much. information. in the world. The question is: how will we use it?</p></p></p>
