<p>"I think we are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people <br />we used to be, whether we find them attractive company or not. <br />Otherwise they turn up unannounced and surprise us, come hammering on <br />the mind's door at 4am of a bad night and demand to know who deserted <br />them, who betrayed tem, who is going to make amends. We forget all too <br />soon the things we thought we could never forget. We forget the loves <br />and the betrayals alike, forget what we whispered and what we <br />screamed, forget who we were." -pg.139, "On Keeping a Notebook" by <br />Joan Didion.</p>
