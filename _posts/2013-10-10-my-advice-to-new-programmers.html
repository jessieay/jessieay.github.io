<p>I was recently asked to give advice to people new to programming. Here is what I wrote up in reply:</p>
<p>Nothing is fun when you first start doing it. Do you remember learning to write? I do. I'm a lefty and my teachers had a hard time teaching me how to make my letters look like anything resembling English. My first grade teacher used to make me re-write my daily journal entires over and over until they looked "neat." Needless to say, I hated journal time and I hated writing.</p>
<p> These days, of course, I don't mind writing. In fact, I write for fun. The medium may be different (who really writes by hand these days?) but the activity is the same. So what happened in the 20+ years since first grade Jessie hated journal time at school?</p>
<p> I got better at it.</p>
<p> I'm often asked what advice I have for people new to programming, people without a computer science degree who want to take the plunge but don't know how to get started. My list of recommended tutorials, books, and screencasts is growing all the time, but I view those kinds of tips as secondary. My primary advice is this: stick with it.</p>
<p> When I first started learning Ruby, I interviewed for a Rails internship at a start-up. In the interview, I was asked to solve a problem on the white board. The question: take an array and write a method that loops over the array, doubles each number, and returns an array of those values. This is a trivial problem to solve with Ruby, so I naturally completely froze up and fudged the question. Needless to say, I left that interview with no internship and less confidence than ever that I could make it as a programmer.</p>
<p> It's been over 3 years since I saw Ruby code for the first time. I didn't consistently enjoy writing Ruby until a little over a year ago. I had glimpses of hope before that. I'd solve a problem that had seemed impossible the day before or debug an issue after 15 minutes instead of 50. But for the most part, it was a slog. I felt like my first grade self: why did this seem so much easier for everyone else than it was for me?</p>
<p> I'm sure there are some people for whom programming comes naturally. But for me, it did not. Today I love nothing more than writing beautiful functions in JavaScript and Ruby, but it took me a long time to get to this place. Before that, it was mostly just a pain.</p>
<p> So when people ask me for advice, all I can say is this: it's normal to hate it at first. The natural response to sucking at something is to hate it. But if you stick with it, you will get better. It's not rocket science. For the most part, i's not even really math. It's just logical reasoning, organization, and lots and lots of practice. I think the same could be said for anything, but programming has a particularly steep learning curve. There is an entire lexicon to learn. But with due time, you, too, will be discussing the difference between Cucumber and Capybara, Unicorn and Thin, and RVM and Rbenv without thinking anything of it.Â </p>
