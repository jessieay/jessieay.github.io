<p>While I hate the feeling that everyone is mourning Steve Jobs as if he is already dead rather than just stepping down from his role as CEO. But, there are some gems in <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/08/24/steve-jobss-best-quotes/">this WSJ article</a> on Steve Jobs quotes.

<div><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">“The problem with the Internet startup craze isn’t that too many people are starting companies; it’s that too many people aren’t sticking with it. That’s somewhat understandable, because there are many moments that are filled with despair and agony, when you have to fire people and cancel things and deal with very difficult situations. That’s when you find out who you are and what your values are.</span></div>

<div style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">“So when these people sell out, even though they get fabulously rich, they’re gypping themselves out of one of the potentially most rewarding experiences of their unfolding lives. Without it, they may never know their values or how to keep their newfound wealth in perspective.” [<a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/01/24/272277/" style="color:rgb(9,61,114);text-decoration:none;border-bottom-width:1px;border-bottom-color:rgb(9,61,114);border-bottom-style:solid;">Fortune, Jan. 24, 2000</a>]</div>

<div><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">“Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.</span></div>

<div><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">“Unfortunately, that’s too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.

<p>“When you’re young, you look at television and think, There’s a conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realize that’s not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want. That’s a far more depressing thought. Conspiracy is optimistic! You can shoot the bastards! We can have a revolution! But the networks are really in business to give people what they want. It’s the truth.” [<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.02/jobs_pr.html" style="color:rgb(9,61,114);text-decoration:none;border-bottom-width:1px;border-bottom-color:rgb(9,61,114);border-bottom-style:solid;">Wired, February 1996</a><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:19px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">]</span></div>

And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle.” [<a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html" style="color:rgb(9,61,114);text-decoration:none;border-bottom-width:1px;border-bottom-color:rgb(9,61,114);border-bottom-style:solid;">Stanford commencement speech, June 2005</a>]</span></div></p></p></p></p>
