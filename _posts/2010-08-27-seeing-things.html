<div>I am currently devouring Tobias Wolff&#039;s novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Old-School-Tobias-Wolff/dp/0375701494/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1282884099&amp;sr=8-8">Old School</a>.
<p>When I read this paragraph, it reminded me of how strange everything was for me in Santiago, and how acutely I perceived that strangeness:<br />  </p>

<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex;"><p>For a moment I saw this place as I had first seen it: how beautiful it was, and how odd. I felt its seclusion and how we&#039;d come to resemble each other in that seclusion. We dressed so much alike that the inflections we did allow ourselves–tasseled loafers for the playboy, a black turtleneck for the rebel–were probably invisible to an outsider. Our clothes, the way we wore our hair, the very set of our mouths, all this marked us like tribal tattoos. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now I am back in the city I grew up in. I am no longer an outsider. Try as I might, it&#039;s difficult for me to recognize the idiosyncrasies of these people and this place. Because I am one of them, and it is my home.</p>
