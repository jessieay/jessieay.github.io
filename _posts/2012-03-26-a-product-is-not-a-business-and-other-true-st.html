<p>An idea is not a design, <br />but it is an invitation to a journey.
<p> A design is not a prototype, <br />but it is a plan for moving forward.
<p> A prototype is not a program, <br />but it is a test for your assumptions.
<p> A program is not a product, <br />but it is a milestone towards progress.
<p> A product is not a business, <br />but it is the first fruit of an idea.
<p> A business is not profits, <br />but it is a team behind your back.
<p> Profits is not an exit, <br />but it is validation of your work.
<p> And an exit is not happiness, <br />but happiness is not a destination.
<p> Happiness is a journey.
