<p>I&#039;ve recently taken to recording good street music with my phone. I would say that <a href="http://bobulate.com/post/555769002/endangered-sounds">this Bobulate post</a> was the inspiration for this new hobby
<p>Ever wondered what it would be like to walk down the street in the Providencia neighborhood of Santiago de Chile on a mid-July afternoon in 2010 and encounter some people singing opera? Well, now you know.
<p> This is a test to see how music files work on Posterous. Maybe I have a future in audio blogging!?</p></p>
