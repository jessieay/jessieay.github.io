<p>## Email 1:
<p> Hi Jessie,
<p> We're a unique executive search firm in that all our partners have <br />built and run businesses in their own right.
<p> I'm reaching out to you on a funded, pre IPO opportunity in the <br />enterprise application space based in San Francisco that you may be <br />interested in. Prime SF location.
<p> Reporting directly to the CMO, we are looking for someone to take the <br />lead of marketing operations activities and the larger inbound <br />marketing strategy for the company. It's a vibrant, well-funded <br />opportunity. The SaaS based service is up, running and generating <br />revenue. This is a high profile company with a lot of attention <br />focused on it.
<p> I'd welcome the opportunity to speak with you further about the role <br />and the company if this could be of interest to you.
<p> Cheers,
<p> ## Email 2:
<p> Hi Jessie,
<p> I’m working with a V.C. backed, start-up with an office in San Mateo <br />that provides cloud-based (SaaS) solutions focusing on mobility and <br />B2B networking. It’s already a profitable company that has built an <br />impressive list of clients.
<p> We are looking to add a highly motivated and talented Product Manager <br />to their team. I came across your profile and was impressed with your <br />background. The role is both challenging and rewarding and the company <br />is looking to grow.
<p> Please let me know your availability for a call and I’d be happy to <br />send over additional information on the company after we speak.
<p> All the best,</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>
