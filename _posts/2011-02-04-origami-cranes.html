<p>The other week I came upon an origami set and decided that I&#039;d like to master the art of paper crane making. I originally learned from my Japanese friend in Chile, but over the course of a few months I&#039;d forgotten how to even start.
<p> I began by trying to follow the half-visible instructions that came with the origami set, but it wasn&#039;t coming back to me. So, like any person of the modern era, I went to Google and quickly found a video tutorial and written instructions.
<p> My first crane took a while to make, as I was very carefully following the instructions, but at the end of step 12 it looked pretty much like it was supposed to look. For my second crane, I tried to start from memory but quickly needed to refer back to the Google. After a few steps, I felt like I knew what I was doing and finished on my own. I went on to create another crane, for good measure.
<p> Last week, I went to make yet another paper crane. Once again, I needed the instructions to get me going, but I finished it quite easily and felt proud as I stared at my family of four cranes.
<p>Last night, I went to make yet another paper crane. Once again, I needed the instructions. But when I finished the crane, I realized something: all of my cranes looked slightly off. The first crane had a slimmer body, and these were all box-like. In my rush my feel like an origami expert, I&#039;d skipped a step on each subsequent crane.
<p> Why am I telling this story? Because I think it illustrates, in a micro way, what happens when we learn. At first, we are totally dependent on instructions and work slowly and meticulously. Once we get a bit more brave, we take a stab at things and probably mess them up. It isn&#039;t until we become more experienced that we can recognize the difference between doing good work and doing great work. My eye had not previously been trained to recognize the difference between a correctly made crane and an incorrectly made crane, but after enough repetitions it became obvious to me that I wasn&#039;t doing something quite right. Nobody needed to tell me, it just emerged as the truth once I&#039;d given it enough time and effort.
<p> I find this especially heartening as I prepare myself for another weekend of Ruby. I signed up for a women&#039;s workshop and have been feeling hesitant to go because I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m ready. But if computer programming is anything like crane making, I&#039;m sure with enough tries I&#039;ll eventually understand what in the world I&#039;m trying to do.</p></p></p></p>
