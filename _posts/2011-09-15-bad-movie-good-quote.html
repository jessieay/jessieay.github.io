<div>Last night I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1262981/">World&#039;s Greatest Dad</a>Â on Netflix Streaming.</div>
<p>
<div>The trailer was good, the movie was pretty bad.</div>
<p>
<div> BUT it ended with a very interesting quote:</div>
<p>
<div><span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:18px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">&quot;I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone. It&#039;s not. The worst thing in life is ending up with people who make you feel all alone.&quot;</span></div>
<p>
<div><span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:18px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);">So perhaps it was worth the 99 minutes of my life.</span></div></p></p>
