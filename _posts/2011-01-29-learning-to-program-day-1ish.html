<p>I&#039;ve been meaning to learn to program for a while now. I&#039;ve worked for two companies that use Ruby, so I chose to start with Ruby. I went to a weekend-long <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/">Rails outreach for women</a> workshop. As a total beginner, it was highly confusing. I told myself I would go home and continue to learn, but I got distracted and here I am 3 months later and not much more program-y.
<p> This week I&#039;ve been trying to change that. I downloaded a PDF of Chris Pine&#039;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Program-Pragmatic-Programmers-Chris/dp/0976694042">Learn to Program</a> onto my Kindle and I&#039;m reading it. (side note: reading PDFs on a Kindle is the worst. Is there a way to make PDFs into Kindle format?) Today, I started a page on my personal wiki to store the Ruby resources I&#039;ve found over the past few months but never bothered to categorize. Then, I looked up more resources and searched Quora for good ways to start learning Ruby.
<p> I even watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6U-i4gXkLM&amp;feature=player_embedded">this</a> one-hour MIT lecture from their undergrad intro to computer programming course. It&#039;s about Python, but given my total lack of knowledge on programming, learning the basics in any way I can is a big help. Plus, I love the way this professor uses the word &quot;administrivia.&quot; Plus, sitting down in front of a lecture (as opposed to doing a tutorial) brings me back to college and my Pavlovian response is to actually pay attention and take notes as opposed to going in the kitchen to make myself yet another PB&amp;J.
<p> Here I go.</p></p>
