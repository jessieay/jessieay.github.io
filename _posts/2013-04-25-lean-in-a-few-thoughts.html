<p><a href="http://jessieay.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/lean_in_large.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-161287210" alt="lean_in_large" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/lean_in_large.jpeg" width="175" height="289" /></a>"Lean In" was the talk of the town for a hot minute. We might even still be in that minute.</p>
<p>My first reaction to the book was that it made too many apologies. At times, it felt like every sentence was prepended with "I support women who want to stay at home, but...". I don't fault Sheryl Sandberg for the choices she's made. I admire her. I've been lucky to work with and know some amazing and amazingly accomplished women, and the last thing I need to hear is them telling me that staying home is a legitimate choice. I know it's a legitimate choice. Now get back to being awesome at what you do so I can follow in your footsteps.</p>
<p>While I didn't love the apologetic tone, the vast majority of the book was spent giving examples of how Sheryl - here it comes - leaned into her career to get where she is today. In that way, "Lean In" is a good read. Sheryl Sandberg is a wonderful role model for a generation of women that doesn't have enough. The criticisms that she isn't relatable are valid. But I don't need relatable; I need aspirational. I know plenty of women in mid-level management positions, but I know just a few at the highest levels. Is it hard to imagine having a healthy relationship and family life while juggling a career as intense as hers? Sure. But at least I know that someone has done it. Or at least I think she has.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my next point: A recent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-women-should-embrace-a-good-enough-life/2013/04/18/4b2b086c-a5db-11e2-a8e2-5b98cb59187f_print.html">Washington Post article</a> by Elsa Walsh summarizes it quite beautifully:</p>
<blockquote><p>By the time I reached the end, I felt deeply ambivalent, particularly on three points.Â First, Sandberg does not seem to get just how hard it is to have a demanding job and a meaningful family life if you cannot afford child care and other help. (She criticizes the lack of family-friendly policies in the workplace and recognizes that some women may find more meaning in staying home, but those small sections read like afterthoughts, or as if someone advised her to include them.)</p>
<p>Second, I suspect that she would probably have written a completely different book if her children were older and she were facing their imminent departure, rather than worrying about their bedtime. (With my daughter poised to leave for college, all I want is to have more time with her, not less.)</p>
<p>And third, I have to wonder if Sandberg does not realize that she is going to die someday. There is so little life and pleasure in her book outside of work. Even sex is framed as something that men will get more of if they pitch in and help their working wives.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I do not claim to have all the answers on what makes for a meaningful life, I do know that a strong family life, quality time with loved ones, and loving, supportive relationships are going to be a part of any life that I hope to have in the coming years. Is it impossible to have these alongside a kick-ass career? Certainly not. But will they play second fiddle to a career? Not for me.</p>
<p>As Walsh says, "I have to wonder if Sandberg does not realize that she is going to die someday." Nothing is harder than approaching each day with that fact in mind. And so, while I appreciate all of Sheryl's advice on how to have an amazing career, I cannot recommend the lessons in book without putting them in the context of a life that has meaning outside of the workplace.</p>
