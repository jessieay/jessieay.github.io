<p>I just finished reading Adam Gopnik&#039;s recent New Yorker piece on desserts, or, as he puts it, &quot;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/01/03/110103fa_fact_gopnik?printable=true">The science and imagination behind modern dessert</a>&quot;
<p> I am a sweets person all the way. My childhood favorite food was corn on the cob, the sweeter the better. As a &quot;grown up,&quot; I eat almost anything, but I especially love desserts.
<p>So, as I read the article, I found myself highlighting a sentence in nearly every paragraph. Delicious wouldn&#039;t let me save them all, so it&#039;s Posterous to the rescue!
<p> Alex Stupak, chef at WD-50 in New York:<br />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex;">Pastry is the closest that a human being can get to creating a new food. A savory chef will look at puff pastry not as a combination of ingredients but as an ingredient in itself. Pastry is infinitely exciting, because it’s less about showing the greatness of nature, and more about transmitting taste and flavor. Desserts are naturally denatured food. Birthday cake is the most denatured thing on earth. </p></blockquote>
<p>White House pastry chef Bill Yosses:<br />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex;">Dessert is aspirational. It’s the one part of the meal you don’t have to eat. It’s the purest part of the meal: the art part. But it’s also the greediest part, the eat-it-in-a-closet part. We don’t have to have it, and we do. </p></blockquote>
<div>Jordi Butrón, chief scientist-cook ta EspaiSucre, a working research laboratory and school of desserts in Barcelona:
<p />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex;"> If I say to you, ‘Apple and cinnamon,’ you would click in immediately. ‘Yes, apple! Yes, cinnamon!’ The library of your mind contains that. But what if I say ‘Apple, asafetida’? Nothing! You have nothing stored there. Now, this is a benefit to the chef, because <b>if I do apple and cinnamon and you don’t like it you think there’s something wrong with me, but if I do apple and asafetida and you don’t like it there’s something wrong with you.</b> </p></blockquote>
<div>On why we, as a species, love sugar so much:
<p />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex;">Our nearest relations among the primates, particularly chimps, have a “supra threshold”: they love sweets and will practically die to get them—and this, the theory goes, is one of the things that make them forage over extremely large territories, outside the forest. They strolled on all fours, then walked, then ran, just to have dessert. </p></blockquote>
<div>On Ferran Adría, chef at elBulli in Barcelona:
<p />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex;">Like every first-rate artist, he has the kind of immense egomania that is oddly impersonal: his greatness is so uncontroversial to him that it is an act of generosity to try to limit it in words and dates. There is a certain kind of artistic egotism that is enveloping rather than narrowing: less “All I care about is my work” than “If you only cared about my work as much as I do, you would be as routinely elated as I am.” </p></blockquote>
<p> <br />On asking Ferran about sweet and salty:
<p />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex;">Were we, I asked, on the verge of entirely breaking down the line between sweet and savory?</p></blockquote>
<div> </div>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex;"><p>He looked at me with delighted triumph. “It can’t be that an American is asking me that!” he said. “A hamburger with ketchup and Coca-Cola? That’s the most intense symbiosis of sweet and savory imaginable. It’s your cultural theme.” </p></blockquote>
<div> On how elBulli serenades wine:
<p />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex;">A long, low-lying wine cellar sits just across an allée of trees from the restaurant, and in it Josep Roca, the second, sommelier brother—the oldest brother, Joan, is in the kitchen—keeps his wines in tenderly nourishing musical environments, playing recorded melodies in the caves: Bach for the champagne, romantic cello music for the Burgundys, and local guitar music for the Spanish wines. </p></blockquote>
<div>On what Gopnik learned from the great pastry chefs of Barcelona:
<p />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex;"> “Techno-emotional” cooking was created only for the three-star stage. It was pure performance, cabaret cooking, the table as stadium show. As often happens with the avant-gardists, by advancing the form they had only deepened the crisis. There was nothing that you could do with what I had learned, other than serve cake and ice cream while the soccer game was on, which we knew how to do already.<br />  </p></blockquote>
