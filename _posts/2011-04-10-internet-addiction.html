<p>&quot;It&#039;s no accident that &#039;search&#039; is the dominant metaphor of the Internet. And it&#039;s no accident that the Internet attracts a certain kind of young, dreamy mind at some liberty to find itself–the type that in earlier eras might have been drawn to novels or movies. As Binx Boiling puts it in &#039;The Movie Goer&quot;: &#039;What is the nature of the search? you ask. Really it is very simple; at least for a fellow like me. So simple that it is often overlooked. <b>The search is what anyone would undertake if he were not sunk in the everydayness of his own life</b><b>.</b>&quot;
