<p>There's a reason people call certain photos "candid" - the vast <br />majority of photos we take are posed. I am guilty of having a "photo <br />smile." I do the same smile in every photo. A smile, I'm told, that I <br />never do when I'm not being photographed. Although I have almost 1,000 <br />tagged photos of myself on Facebook, how I actually look in day-to-day <br />life is a complete mystery to me.
<p> For these reasons, this video of people who think they are posing for <br />pictures is most excellent: <br /><a href="http://gawker.com/5910211/marcel-the-shell-director-surreptitiously-films-friends-striking-photo-pose-inadvertently-makes-profound-statement-about-the-brevity-of-happiness">http://gawker.com/5910211/marcel-the-shell-director-surreptitiously-films-fri...</a>
<p> It shows how posed we are in photos. That even photos that are made to <br />look "normal" are taken of people who sit still for several seconds in <br />order to compose the ideal shot.
<p> It's also pretty funny.</p></p>
