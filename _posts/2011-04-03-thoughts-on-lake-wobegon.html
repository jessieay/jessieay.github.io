<p>I was on a 10 minute drive today when Garrison Keillor's <a href="http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/">A Prairie Home Companion</a> came on. When I hear his voice, I always think of my dad, sitting in the driver's seat on a long drive smiling as he listens to NPR.
<p> I can't find the segment I heard online, but it was a great one. There was a thick fog in Lake Wobegon that week and Keillor says this makes everyone slow down to 25 mph. And so, everyone can see things even better than usual. Because you can't see much at 50 mph, but you really start to notice your surroundings at 25 mph. That's irony: from a lack of clarity comes ever more clarity (this is his insight, not mine).
<p> The other notable part of the episode was his commentary on kids: parents send their kids to good schools so that they will be successful. And then those kids do become successful, they become incredibly busy, and their parents never get to see them or really know them as adults. The kids who struggle, on the other hand, do end up spending a lot of time with their parents. Think: the 30-year-old living in his parents' basement. That's the irony of parenting: if you're successful, you'll never get to spend much time with your kids.
<p> I had such a great time listening that I just sat in my parked car until it ended. I think I might subscribe to the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/apm-a-prairie-home-companions/id215352157">podcast on iTunes</a>.</p></p></p>
