<p>- It is a very underrated meat. When was the last time you heard someone say, &quot;I&#039;m in the mood for a salami sandwich&quot; - never, right? That&#039;s because the salami people don&#039;t have good marketing like the dairy people do.
<p> - I bought a package of salami today at 4pm and have already eaten three salami sandwiches. From this experience, I can tell you that salami tastes most excellent when paired with Gouda, avocado, and Gouda + avocado.
<p> - When you really think about it, salami tastes kind of like hot dog. I love hot dogs, too.
<p>- I wonder why salami is so greasy feeling. Actually - scratch that - I don&#039;t want to know.
<p>- I once saw a girl become un-vegetarian for salami. This is a true story. For the record, it was one of those giant Costco packages of salami. They are so enticing.
<p> - As a smaller human, I once went on a several day backpacking trip with a camp in the Sierras of California. We had to carry everything we were going to eat, so the food situation was pretty bleak. The one glimmer of hope was that we each were given a stick of salami. I never buy salami in this form, but I recommend it if you ever have to carry all of your food on your back because it is quite resilient. In fact, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salami">Wikipedia</a> tells me that salami can be stored at room temperature for up to ten years. Sick.
<p> - Say &quot;salami&quot; five times fast. The word will become meaningless and you will realize how silly it is. But it will still taste delicious.</p></p></p></p>
