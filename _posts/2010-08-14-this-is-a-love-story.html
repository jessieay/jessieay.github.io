<p>&quot;This is a love story. However, its roots are tangled and involve a good bit of my life, and when I recall my life my mood turns sour and I am reminded that no man makes truly proper use of his time. We are blind and small-minded. We are dumb as snails about the importance of things. I&#039;m an average man, without great deeds except maybe one, and that has been to love my wife.&quot;
<p> &quot;Francine and I are married now for forty-six years, and I would be a bamboozler to say that I have loved her for any more than half of these. Let us say that for the last year I haven&#039;t; let us say that for the last ten, even. Time has made torments of our small differences and tolerances of our passions. This is our state of affairs. Now I stand by myself in our kitchen in the middle of the night; now I lead a secret life. We wake at different hours now, sleep in different corners of the bed. We like different food and different music, keep our clothing in different drawers, and if it can be said that either of us has aspirations, I believe that they are to a different bliss. Also, she is healthy and I am ill. And as for conversation–that feast of reason, that flow of the soul–our house is silent as the bone yard.&quot;
<p> - both from &quot;We Are Nighttime Travelers,&quot; a story in Ethan Canin&#039;s <i>Emperor of the Air</i>.</p></p>
