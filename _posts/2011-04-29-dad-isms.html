<div>I spend part of my time working with Andy Smith and Jennifer Aaker on marketing and editorial work for their book, <a href="http://thedragonflyeffect.com/">The Dragonfly Effect</a>.</div>
<p>
<p>I was just watching a <a href="http://current.com/technology/93185622_father-and-daughter-professors-and-the-psychology-of-time.htm">video</a> from 2009 of Jennifer and her dad, David Aaker, speaking at Stanford. After the Professors Aaker briefly discuss their respective areas of research,&nbsp;Jennifer presents a bunch of her dad's "isms." They had me laughing out loud, so I wanted to write them down for posterity.</p>
<p>
<div>- Best response to a question: "That's a good question. I wrote a book that addresses that question. Have you read my book?"</div>
<div>- "This is the worst sentence I have ever read." (I guess when he first started reading her stuff, he would write this as a comment on Jennifer's writing a lot)</div>
<div>- "I've never empirically tested this, but I have a strong suspicion that if you buy people things, they will like you more." (Apparently this makes for a good parenting strategy)</div>
<div>- "One of the most important things to do when you start a new job: carve out clear areas of incompetence." (Jennifer has a good anecdote about one of her students who joined McKinsey and on the first day told them he isn't good with numbers. He ended up moving up faster than anyone else because he didn't get bogged down in work he wasn't good at)</div></p>
