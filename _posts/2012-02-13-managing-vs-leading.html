<p>I always read the Corner Office column in the Sunday NYT. Sometimes it disappoints, but it&#039;s always interesting to hear what business leaders think about. They frequently have helpful frameworks for how to view the world.
<p> This Sunday, they profiled Tim Bucher, CEO of TastingRoom.com. A website which, incidentally, supplied my mom&#039;s Christmas present via my brother-in-law this Christmas. I thought it was a great present and tweeted as such.
<p> Here&#039;s are the bits I wanted to share from his Q &amp; A:
<p>On managing vs. leading:<br />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;"> There’s a saying I like: Management is about doing things right — dotting the I’s, crossing the T’s, giving reviews, doing all the H.R. stuff. But leadership is about doing the right thing. And it’s very different. There might be a situation with a team member, for example, that should be handled a certain way, according to H.R. But as a leader, you have to understand the broader context. You have to make a call, and in some ways it might be against company policy.<br /> That’s why I also like smaller companies, because you can violate company policy a little easier than you can at large corporations to maybe help someone, maybe even giving them $1,000 to take care of some financial emergency. And when you do the right thing, you usually have an employee for life. They’re very motivated to work for you and work for the company, and I think the output is just tremendous compared to whatever the expense was.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the &quot;right answer&quot; to the interview question &quot;When you think back on the time that you were the most excited about what you were doing, you couldn&#039;t wait to get out of bed and you couldn&#039;t shut off at night, what were you doing and why?&quot; <br />
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;">What I’m really looking for is what makes them tick. The worst answer you can give me is, “I don’t know.”</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;">I’ve had that answer, so many times. Boom, they’re gone. Bye-bye. There are some people who just aren’t go-getters. The other wrong move is to try to give me an answer that you think I want to hear. That one’s hilarious.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;">Well, if they’re interviewing for a certain job, and if I hear them essentially recite the job description to me, they’re gone.</p></blockquote>
<div>the right answer:</div>
<p>
<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;"> They could tell me it was when they were a forest ranger. I might be hiring them for a software engineering position, but they tell me that when they were up in the tower, they liked being in charge of spotting all the fires. I literally had one person tell me this. And it was super-exciting, because what I got from them was that they really liked responsibility. I&#039;ll take that answer any day.</p></blockquote>
