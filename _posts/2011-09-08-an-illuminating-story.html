<p>I heard Austan Goolsbee, former chairman of the Council of Economic <br />Advisers in the Obama administration, tell this story while listening <br />to NPR the other day. It explains a lot about why, sometimes, being <br />inexperienced gives someone a competitive advantage. Fearlessness!
<p> SAGAL: Oh my god. Well tell me what it was like. Well first of all, <br />you know, you just left. How does it feel? I mean, did you enjoy your <br />time in DC? You were there for a good three years.
<p> Mr. GOOLSBEE: Well, you know, I always said that I didn't go for the <br />fun, and I wasn't disappointed.
<p> SAGAL: Right.
<p> Mr. GOOLSBEE: Because it wasn't. It was a strange moment. And there <br />was a time when I was flying back on a flight to Midway, and we went <br />through a terrible thunderstorm, and the flight is really bouncing <br />around and horrible turbulence, and I don't get very nervous flying. <br />But in the row, two rows ahead of me, there was an older woman on the <br />aisle and there was a young kid by the window. And as the plane is <br />jerking around, the woman begins screaming "we're going to die."
<p> And everyone looks around and then, whoom, it really jerks down and <br />the lights kind of go out on one side of the plane. And she continues <br />screaming, "Oh God, we're going to die." So the people on the plane <br />are looking around. "Nobody's saying we're not going to die; maybe we <br />are going to die."
<p> And so finally we land and they come off, and she gets off and she's <br />very shaken. And she was sitting next to this kid who was just staring <br />out the window the whole time, like, oh God, please don't. And so I <br />say to that kid, I said wow that was some flight, huh? And the kid <br />said, "This was my first time on an airplane. Is it always like this?"
<p> And I realized after three years in DC, I was that kid.</p></p></p></p>
